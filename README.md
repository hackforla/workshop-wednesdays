# Workshop Wednesdays

Purpose of project “Workshop Wednesday” is to create a specialized platform/application for recording live streaming video lectures and workshops delivered on a dedicated platform created by Hack for LA and seamlessly integrating the backend with a scheduler and basic video editor to upload the videos on You-Tube Channel post getting automatically edited as per supervised inputs on a specified time. It aims to replace traditional method of manual intervention for editing & scheduling the videos which is generally cumbersome and time-consuming.

# How to contribute

Explain the different ways people can contribute. For example:

- Join the team {on Slack/at our weekly hack night/etc}.
- To help with user research, {do ABC}.
- To provide design support, {do XYZ}.
- To contribute to the code, follow the instructions below.

Remember to provide direct links to each channel.



## Installation instructions

1. Step-by-step instructions help new contributors get a development environment up and running quickly.
2. You'll want to find the balance between being specific enough for novices to follow, without being so specific that you reinvent the wheel by providing overly-basic instructions that can be found elsewhere.
3. Feel free to adapt this section and its sub-sections to your own processes.
4. Alternatively, you can move everything from *Installation instructions* through *Testing* to a separate **Contributing.md** file to keep your **ReadMe.md** more succinct.


### Working with issues
